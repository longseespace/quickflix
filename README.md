Getting Started
---------------

Just clone the repo and install the necessary node modules:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/longseespace/quickflix.git
$ cd quickflix
$ npm install                   # Install Node modules listed in ./package.json (may take a while the first time)
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

Usage
-----

Before delving into the descriptions of each available npm script, here's a brief summary of the three which will most likely be your bread and butter:

* Doing live development? Use `npm start` to spin up the dev server.
* Compiling the application to disk? Use `npm run compile`.
* Deploying to an environment? `npm run deploy` can help with that.

**NOTE:** This package makes use of [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) to improve your debugging experience. For convenience, all of messages are prefixed with `app:*`. If you'd like to to change what debug statements are displayed, you can override the `DEBUG` environment variable via the CLI (e.g. `DEBUG=app:* npm start`) or tweak the npm scripts (`betterScripts` in `package.json`).

Great, now that introductions have been made here's everything in full detail:

|`npm run...`|Description|
|---|---|
|`start`|Spins up Koa server to serve your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon to automatically restart the server when server-related code is changed.|
|`dev:nw`|Same as `npm run dev`, but opens the redux devtools in a new window.|
|`dev:no-debug`|Same as `npm run dev` but disables redux devtools.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`deploy`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`deploy:dev`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "development".|
|`deploy:prod`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "production".|
|`flow:check`|Analyzes the project for type errors.|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).|

**NOTE:** Deploying to a specific environment? Make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` so webpack will use the correct configuration. For example: `NODE_ENV=production npm run compile` will compile your application with `~/config/_production.js`.

### Configuration

Basic project configuration can be found in `~/config/_base.js`. Here you'll be able to redefine your `src` and `dist` directories, adjust compilation settings, tweak your vendor dependencies, and more. For the most part, you should be able to make changes in here **without ever having to touch the webpack build configuration**.

If you need environment-specific overrides (useful for dynamically setting API endpoints, for example), create a file with the name of target `NODE_ENV` prefixed by an `_` in `~/config` (e.g. `~/config/_production.js`). This can be entirely arbitrary, such as `NODE_ENV=staging` where the config file is `~/config/_staging.js`.

Common configuration options:

|Key|Description|
|---|---|
|`dir_src`|application source code base path|
|`dir_dist`|path to build compiled application to|
|`server_host`|hostname for the Koa server|
|`server_port`|port for the Koa server|
|`compiler_css_modules`|whether or not to enable CSS modules|
|`compiler_devtool`|what type of source-maps to generate (set to `false`/`null` to disable)|
|`compiler_vendor`|packages to separate into to the vendor bundle|

Structure
---------

The folder structure provided is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. It is something that has worked very well for me and my team, but use only what makes sense to you.

```

### Components vs. Views vs. Layouts

**TL;DR:** They're all components.

This distinction may not be important for you, but as an explanation: A **Layout** is something that describes an entire page structure, such as a fixed navigation, viewport, sidebar, and footer. Most applications will probably only have one layout, but keeping these components separate makes their intent clear. **Views** are components that live at routes, and are generally rendered within a **Layout**. What this ends up meaning is that, with this structure, nearly everything inside of **Components** ends up being a dumb component.

Webpack
-------

### Vendor Bundle
You can redefine which packages to bundle separately by modifying `compiler_vendor` in `~/config/_base.js`. These default to:

```js
[
  'history',
  'react',
  'react-redux',
  'react-router',
  'react-router-redux',
  'redux'
]
```

### Webpack Root Resolve
Webpack is configured to make use of [resolve.root](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-root), which lets you import local packages as if you were traversing from the root of your `~/src` directory. Here's an example:

```js
// current file: ~/src/views/some/nested/View.js

// What used to be this:
import SomeComponent from '../../../components/SomeComponent'

// Can now be this:
import SomeComponent from 'components/SomeComponent' // Hooray!
```

### Globals

These are global variables available to you anywhere in your source code. If you wish to modify them, they can be found as the `globals` key in `~/config/_base.js`. When adding new globals, also add them to `~/.eslintrc`.

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|`process.env.NODE_ENV`|the active `NODE_ENV` when the build started|
|`__DEV__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development`|
|`__PROD__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `production`|
|`__TEST__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `test`|
|`__DEBUG__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development` and cli arg `--no_debug` is not set (`npm run dev:no-debug`)|
|`__BASENAME__`|[npm history basename option](https://github.com/rackt/history/blob/master/docs/BasenameSupport.md)|

Server
------

This starter kit comes packaged with an Koa server. It's important to note that the sole purpose of this server is to provide `webpack-dev-middleware` and `webpack-hot-middleware` for hot module replacement. Because of this, it should be noted that the provided server is **not** production-ready. If you're deploying to production, take a look at [the deployment section](#deployment).

Styles
------

Both `.scss` and `.css` file extensions are supported out of the box and are configured to use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). After being imported, styles will be processed with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for minification and autoprefixing, and will be extracted to a `.css` file during production builds.

**NOTE:** If you're importing styles from a base styles directory (useful for generic, app-wide styles), you can make use of the `styles` alias, e.g.:

```js
// current file: ~/src/components/some/nested/component/index.jsx
import 'styles/core.scss' // this imports ~/src/styles/core.scss
```

Furthermore, this `styles` directory is aliased for sass imports, which further eliminates manual directory traversing; this is especially useful for importing variables/mixins.

Here's an example:

```scss
// current file: ~/src/styles/some/nested/style.scss
// what used to be this (where base is ~/src/styles/_base.scss):
@import '../../base';

// can now be this:
@import 'base';
```

Testing
-------

To add a unit test, simply create a `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/tests`. Karma will pick up on these files automatically, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them. If you are using `redux-cli`, test files should automatically be generated when you create a component or redux module (duck).

Coverage reports will be compiled to `~/coverage` by default. If you wish to change what reporters are used and where reports are compiled, you can do so by modifying `coverage_reporters` in `~/config/_base.js`.

Deployment
----------

Out of the box, this starter kit is deployable by serving the `~/dist` folder generated by `npm run compile` (make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` as well). This project does not concern itself with the details of server-side rendering or API structure, since that demands an opinionated structure that makes it difficult to extend later on.
